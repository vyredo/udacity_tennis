- You can open file `Run_Pretrained.ipynb` to run it.
- pretrained model is located at [`Report/actor.pth and Report/critic.pth`](https://github.com/vyredo/udacity_RL_Reacher/tree/main/Report)

From the video we can see that the score for each agent are from 28 to 35

## Learning Algorithm

The agent is implemented using:

1. **DDPG Agent**:

   - The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm leverages a deterministic policy for continuous action spaces.
     It uses an Actor-Critic architecture where:
     - The Actor generates the optimal action for a given state.
     - The Critic evaluates the Q-value of the action-state pair.

2. **ReplayBuffer**:

   - The Replay Buffer stores past experiences as tuples of (state, action, reward, next_state) to break temporal correlations in the data.

3. **OU Noise**:
   - It generates temporally correlated noise to encourage exploration while maintaining smooth changes in actions

The whole training is done for **202 episodes**.
